  # Lab Report 4
  ---
  In this lab report, I will be discussing about what I did to reproduce what I did in Week 7 lab.
  ---

  The steps in the lab were as followed:
  ```
  1. Setup Delete any existing forks of the repository you have on your account
  2. Setup Fork the repository
  3. The real deal Start the timer!
  4. Log into ieng6
  5. Clone you rfork of the repository from your Github account
  6. Run the test, demonstrating that they fail.
  7. Edit the code file ListExamples.java to fix the failing test (as a reminder, the error in the code is just that index1 is used instead of index2 in the final    loop in merge)
  8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed.
  9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account.
  ```

  Starting from step 4.

  I pressed the <up> arrow key once for the ssh command because I had already logged in previously before my wifi disconnecting.

  I then typed the command `git clone https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7` into the terminal to clone the repository `lab7` to my computer locally.

  *Note*: Since I had already done this in lab, to recreate what you would see I used the command `rm -fr lab7`. This command removes using `rm` lab7's directory and its contents recursively. `-f` means to forcefully delete them without asking permission and `r` makes it so `rm` deletes its contents and recrusively. I found this command through visiting this [website](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/delete-local-git-repository-repo-command-windows-linux-rm#:~:text=Command%20line%20Git%20repository%20delete&text=Just%20run%20the%20rm%20command,and%20folder%20to%20remain%20untouched).
